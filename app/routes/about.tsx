				<p>
					This website is the personal website for Zeff Svoboda, his projects,
					and other such nonsense.
				</p>

			<MainSection title="About the Person">
				<p>
					Zeff Svoboda is a software engineer and an unabashed, multifaceted
					geek. Through self-taught and formal education, he has explored
					everything from Web and software development, electronics design, and
					system and network administration. He also thinks a lot about
					politics, social justice, language, and urban planning. A modest,
					sociable introvert with a passion for learning and sharing, he hates
					writing in the third person (but someone's gotta do it).
				</p>
				<p>
					Born and raised in the Twin Cities, Zeff earned his bachelor's degree
					in Computer Engineering with a minor in Linguistics from the
					University of Minnesota. He has spent the last decade honing his
					software development skills, starting from humble HTML websites full
					of <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>s and bad graphics through to complex,
					modular, testable APIs and UIs for Web and desktop platforms. His
					primary areas of interest include Web frameworks and standards,
					development tooling, and programming language design.
				</p>
				<p>
					Beside software, Zeff enjoys recreational cycling and fencing,
					planning to go backpacking someday, and working on old cars and trying
					not to buy more.

			<MainSection title="About the Name">
				<p>The reasons I chose this domain name are three-fold:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						a play on words, making light of the notion of mutable "constants"
						in programming languages like C++;
					</li>
					<li>
						a philosophical acknowledgement of the equally absurd "constant
						change" dichotomy of reality; and
					</li>
					<li>
						a reference to a track by Boards of Canada, one of my favorite
						musical groups, called "Constants Are Changing" from their 2005
						release <cite>The Campfire Headphase</cite>.
					</li>
