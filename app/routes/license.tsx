        <p>
          Copyright is a tricky subject. While I fully support the original
          purpose of copyright law—to incentivize authors and inventors to
          create more to share—I am disappointed in what it has become.

          And while I fully respect everyone's individual right to choose how
          best to share their works and make a living, I must abstain from
          "business as usual". If someone sees value in what I share and thinks
          they can improve upon (or make money from) my work, they have my
          blessing. I hope that my contribution to the inherently collaborative
          process of human expression and knowledge helps inspire others to join
          in.

          However, in order to promote my ideals, I retain all rights provided
          by US and international copyright law. Counter-intuitive as it might
          seem, this is a requirement for "

          licensing.
